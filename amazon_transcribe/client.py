        The service processes audio chunks for this operation in realtime, if
        the audio chunks provided are not coming from a realtime source (e.g. a
        pre-recorded file) the audio chunks should be rate limited to match the
        appropriate realtime bitrate for the stream. Failure to send the audio
        chunks in realtime can lead to signing issues for audio streams longer
        than 5 minutes.

        :param language_code:
            Indicates the source language used in the input audio stream.
        :param media_sample_rate_hz:
            The sample rate, in Hertz, of the input audio. We suggest that you
            use 8000 Hz for low quality audio and 16000 Hz for high quality audio.
        :param media_encoding:
            The encoding used for the input audio.
        :param vocabulary_name:
            The name of the vocabulary to use when processing the transcription job.
        :param session_id:
            A identifier for the transcription session. Use this parameter when you
            want to retry a session. If you don't provide a session ID,
            Amazon Transcribe will generate one for you and return it in the response.
        :param vocab_filter_method:
            The manner in which you use your vocabulary filter to filter words in
            your transcript. See Transcribe Streaming API docs for more info.
        :param vocab_filter_name:
            The name of the vocabulary filter you've created that is unique to
            your AWS account. Provide the name in this field to successfully
            use it in a stream.
        :param show_speaker_label:
            When true, enables speaker identification in your real-time stream.
        :param enable_channel_identification:
            When true, instructs Amazon Transcribe to process each audio channel
            separately and then merge the transcription output of each channel
            into a single transcription. Amazon Transcribe also produces a
            transcription of each item. An item includes the start time, end time,
            and any alternative transcriptions. You can't set both ShowSpeakerLabel
            and EnableChannelIdentification in the same request. If you set both,
            your request returns a BadRequestException.
        :param number_of_channels:
            The number of channels that are in your audio stream.
        :param enable_partial_results_stabilization:
            When true, instructs Amazon Transcribe to present transcription results
            that have the partial results stabilized. Normally, any word or phrase
            from one partial result can change in a subsequent partial result. With
            partial results stabilization enabled, only the last few words of one
            partial result can change in another partial result.
        :param partial_results_stability
            You can use this field to set the stability level of the transcription
            results. A higher stability level means that the transcription results
            are less likely to change. Higher stability levels can come with lower
            overall transcription accuracy. Defaults to "high" if not set explicitly.
